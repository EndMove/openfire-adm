The use of the certificates requires a valid SSL certificate and a domain name.
Automatic installation: Drag and drop your ssl.pem certificate (containing certificate and key) in "Openfire/conf/security/hotdeploy", it will be automatically installed in the certificate manager of Openfire.
Manual installation: ["panel-admin" >> "TLS/SSL Certificates" >> "Manage Store Content"] import your certificate.
